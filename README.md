# ParticleSwarmOptimizer
Yet another C++ implementation of the Canonical Particle Swarm Algorithm.

This implementation is the canonical version and it is easy to use. Check the PSO2.cpp for info on how to use it. 

You need to specify a few things a function to be optimized with its parameters, the data, the number of birds in the flock.

It compiles with C++11 dialect, uses the standard library and openmp.
